# Gravity

A game with C++ and ncurses which tries to simulate gravity.

### Getting Started

Once the source code is downloaded simply just run the make file and execute the
Gravity.out. Attributes in the Item.cpp will determine its characteristics.

To compile
```
make
```
To run

```
./Gravity.out
```

### Controls

After the program is started there are only two controls j to jump and q to quit.

quit
```
q
```

jump
```
j
```

### Technology

C++, Ncurses


### What To Expect If Updated

If I choose to work on this project more I would make the terminal more dynamic and I would create a config file that can be used to adjust the gravity, jump height, ect.
